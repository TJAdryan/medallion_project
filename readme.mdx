# Medallion Architecture with 1000 Genomes Data üß¨

This project demonstrates the **Medallion Architecture** by building a data pipeline to process and transform public genetic data from the 1000 Genomes Project.

The pipeline processes data through three distinct layers:
* **Bronze Layer:** Raw, unstructured data straight from the source.
* **Silver Layer:** Cleaned, validated, and enriched data.
* **Gold Layer:** Aggregated, business-ready data optimized for analysis and reporting.

## üöÄ The Data: 1000 Genomes Project

The dataset used is a subset of the **1000 Genomes Project Phase 3**, which is a widely-used repository for studying human genetic variation.

We will be working with two primary files:
1.  A **Variant Call Format (VCF)** file (`ALL.chr22.vcf.gz`), which contains raw genetic sequence information for individuals on chromosome 22.
2.  A **sample metadata** file (`1000_genomes_samples.txt`), which provides demographic and population information for each individual.

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Setup

### 1. **Prerequisites**

You'll need `uv` to manage the project environment. If you don't have it, you can install it from the official website.
* [Install `uv`](https://astral.sh/uv/install)

### 2. **Environment Setup**

Create a dedicated virtual environment for the project to keep dependencies isolated.

```bash
