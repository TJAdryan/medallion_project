# Medallion Architecture with 1000 Genomes Data 🧬

This project demonstrates the **Medallion Architecture** by building a data pipeline to process and transform public genetic data from the 1000 Genomes Project.

The pipeline processes data through three distinct layers:
* **Bronze Layer:** Raw, unstructured data straight from the source.
* **Silver Layer:** Cleaned, validated, and enriched data.
* **Gold Layer:** Aggregated, business-ready data optimized for analysis and reporting.

## 🚀 The Data: 1000 Genomes Project

The dataset used is a subset of the **1000 Genomes Project Phase 3**, which is a widely-used repository for studying human genetic variation.

We will be working with two primary files:
1.  A **Variant Call Format (VCF)** file (`ALL.chr22.vcf.gz`), which contains raw genetic sequence information for individuals on chromosome 22.
2.  A **sample metadata** file (`1000_genomes_samples.txt`), which provides demographic and population information for each individual.

## 🛠️ Project Setup

### 1. **Prerequisites**

You'll need `uv` to manage the project environment. If you don't have it, you can install it from the official website.
* [Install `uv`](https://astral.sh/uv/install)

### 2. **Environment Setup**

Create a dedicated virtual environment for the project to keep dependencies isolated.

```bash
uv venv
Activate the environment:

macOS/Linux:

Bash

source .venv/bin/activate
Windows:

PowerShell

.venv\Scripts\activate
3. Dependencies
This project uses standard Python libraries. No extra dependencies are needed.

📦 Project Structure
The project is organized to reflect the three layers of the Medallion Architecture.

🪜 The Pipeline Steps
Step 1: Bronze Layer - Data Ingestion
This step involves downloading the raw, compressed VCF file and the metadata file. We will use a simple Python script to handle the download, which represents the first layer of our architecture.

Script: scripts/bronze_ingest.py

Output: data/bronze/ALL.chr22.vcf.gz and data/bronze/1000_genomes_samples.txt

Step 2: Silver Layer - Data Processing & Enrichment
In this step, we will take the raw files from the bronze layer, decompress the VCF file, and parse its contents. We will then join the variant data with the sample metadata to enrich the dataset.

Script: scripts/silver_process.py

Output: A structured, tabular file (e.g., a Parquet file) in the data/silver/ directory.

Step 3: Gold Layer - Data Transformation
This final layer aggregates the clean data from the silver layer into a business-ready format. This could involve calculating variant frequencies, summarizing data by population, or creating other insights.

Script: scripts/gold_transform.py

Output: Final, optimized data for analysis, ready for consumption by BI tools or further research.
